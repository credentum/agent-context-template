# Sprint YAML Template for Agent-First Context System
# This template provides the structure for creating sprint files that agents can use
# to automatically generate GitHub issues and track progress
#
# Usage:
# 1. Copy this file to a new sprint file (e.g., sprint-4.1.yaml)
# 2. Replace all placeholder values with actual sprint data
# 3. Remove this comment block and rename file
# 4. Commit the file to trigger automated issue creation
