## 📌 Task Name
`test-issue-1047-sprint-update-workflow-duplicate-prevention`

## 🎯 Goal (≤ 2 lines)
> Test and validate that the Sprint Update workflow no longer creates duplicate PRs when both pull_request.closed and issues.closed events fire simultaneously, ensuring the duplicate prevention logic works correctly.

## 🧠 Context
- **GitHub Issue**: #1047 - [Sprint 41] Phase 9: Test Sprint Update Workflow Duplicate Prevention
- **Sprint**: Sprint 4.1: Infrastructure Bring-Up
- **Phase**: 9 - Sprint Update Workflow Testing
- **Component**: ci
- **Priority**: high
- **Why this matters**: Previous Sprint Update workflow created duplicate PRs (#106 and #107) causing race conditions and workflow inefficiency
- **Dependencies**: None - this is a validation task for existing fix
- **Related**: Issue #961 (original Sprint Update workflow fix), PRs #106 and #107 (duplicates that occurred)

## 📝 Enhanced RCICO Prompt
**Role**
You are a senior QA engineer and workflow automation specialist working on GitHub Actions workflow testing.

**Context**
GitHub Issue #1047: Test Sprint Update Workflow Duplicate Prevention
The Sprint Update workflow (.github/workflows/sprint-update.yml) was recently fixed to prevent duplicate PR creation when both pull_request.closed and issues.closed events fire simultaneously. The duplicate prevention logic includes:
- Concurrency control (lines 18-21)
- Duplicate run detection (lines 38-87)
- Recent run filtering and cancellation (lines 88-94)
This needs comprehensive testing to ensure it works correctly.

**Instructions**
1. **Primary Objective**: Validate that Sprint Update workflow duplicate prevention logic works correctly
2. **Scope**: Test the concurrency control and duplicate detection mechanisms without breaking existing functionality
3. **Constraints**:
   - Follow existing test patterns in tests/ directory
   - Maintain backward compatibility with current Sprint Update workflow
   - Ensure tests can run in CI environment
4. **Prompt Technique**: Test-Driven Development because we need to verify specific behavior and edge cases
5. **Testing**: Create comprehensive test scenarios including timing, race conditions, and edge cases
6. **Documentation**: Update task template with actual test results and validation outcomes

**Technical Constraints**
• Expected diff ≤ 200 LoC, ≤ 3 files
• Context budget: ≤ 15k tokens
• Performance budget: Fast validation tests
• Code quality: Black formatting, coverage ≥ 71.82%
• CI compliance: All Docker CI checks must pass

**Output Format**
Return complete test implementation and validation results.
Use conventional commits: test(ci): validate sprint update duplicate prevention

## 🔍 Verification & Testing
- `./scripts/run-ci-docker.sh` (Docker CI compliance)
- `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing` (test suite + coverage)
- `pre-commit run --all-files` (code quality)
- **Issue-specific tests**: Test duplicate PR prevention during simultaneous events
- **Integration tests**: End-to-end workflow testing with real PR/issue scenarios
- **Manual validation**: Create test PR that closes this issue and verify single Sprint Update PR creation

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create PR that closes an issue (using "Closes #XXX")
- [ ] Merge PR and verify only one Sprint Update PR is created
- [ ] Verify duplicate detection logic works correctly
- [ ] Confirm no duplicate PRs are generated
- [ ] Test workflow timing and race conditions
- [ ] Workflow logs show duplicate detection working
- [ ] Sprint status updates work correctly
- [ ] No race conditions or timing issues
