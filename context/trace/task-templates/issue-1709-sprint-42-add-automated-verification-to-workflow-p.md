## üéØ Goal (‚â§ 2 lines)
> [SPRINT-4.2] Add automated verification to workflow phases

## üß† Context
- **GitHub Issue**: #1709 - [SPRINT-4.2] Add automated verification to workflow phases
- **Labels**: enhancement, sprint-current, claude-ready
- **Component**: workflow-automation
- **Why this matters**: Resolves reported issue

## üõ†Ô∏è Subtasks

## üìù Issue Description
## Task Context
**Sprint**: sprint-4.2
**Phase**: Phase 3: Bug Fix & CI Improvement
**Component**: workflow-automation

## Scope Assessment
- [x] **Scope is clear** - Requirements are well-defined, proceed with implementation

## Problem Description
The workflow executor bug in #1706 went undetected because issue #1694 appeared to succeed even though it only created documentation instead of implementing the requested code. We need automated verification within each workflow phase to ensure actual work is completed, not just documentation.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The `execute_implementation` phase was setting `code_changes_applied = True` even when only creating documentation
2. No verification step checked if actual code files were modified
3. Success was measured by commit creation, not by implementation completion
4. The validation phase focused on CI/testing but didn't verify implementation happened

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add verification methods to WorkflowExecutor class:
  - [ ] `_verify_code_changes() -> bool` - Checks if non-documentation files were modified
  - [ ] `_verify_acceptance_criteria_addressed() -> Dict[str, bool]` - Parses and checks criteria
  - [ ] `_verify_implementation_matches_template() -> bool` - Ensures implementation aligns with task
- [ ] Integrate verification into execute_implementation:
  - [ ] Call verification after implementation attempt
  - [ ] Set code_changes_applied based on verification result
  - [ ] Log detailed verification results
- [ ] Add phase output validation:
  - [ ] Implementation phase must show which files were modified
  - [ ] Validation phase must verify implementation occurred
  - [ ] Each phase must produce verifiable artifacts
- [ ] Update workflow state to include verification results
- [ ] Add unit tests for all verification methods

## Implementation Strategy
1. Create verification methods that analyze git diff to distinguish code from docs
2. Parse task templates to extract specific implementation requirements
3. Compare actual changes against requirements
4. Fail fast with clear error messages when verification fails
5. Include verification results in workflow state for debugging

## Expected Benefits
- Catch false positive implementations immediately
- Provide clear feedback on what wasn't implemented
- Prevent issues like #1694 from passing incorrectly
- Build confidence in automated workflow execution

## Claude Code Readiness Checklist
- [x] **Context URLs identified** (workflow_executor.py, #1706, #1694)
- [x] **File scope estimated** (1 file modification, ~150 LoC)
- [x] **Dependencies mapped** (git, pathlib, existing workflow code)
- [x] **Test strategy defined** (unit tests with git operation mocking)
- [x] **Breaking change assessment** (backward compatible enhancements)

## Pre-Execution Context
**Key Files**: 
- `scripts/workflow_executor.py` (main implementation target)
- `scripts/workflow_validator.py` (reference for validation patterns)
- `tests/test_workflow_executor.py` (add new tests)

**External Dependencies**:
- git command line tools
- Standard library only

**Configuration**: 
- No new configuration needed
- Uses existing workflow state management

**Related Issues/PRs**: 
- #1706 (implementation bug that this would have caught)
- #1694 (test issue that falsely passed)
- #1708 (comprehensive test for the fix)

## Implementation Notes
The verification should be lightweight but thorough:
- Check git diff to ensure non-doc files changed
- Parse task template acceptance criteria
- Match file changes to stated requirements
- Provide actionable error messages

Example verification output:
```
‚úÖ Code changes detected: 2 files modified (scripts/example.py, tests/test_example.py)
‚úÖ Documentation updated: 1 file (context/trace/task-templates/...)
‚ùå Acceptance criteria partially met:
   ‚úÖ Created new utility function
   ‚ùå Missing unit tests
   ‚ùå Missing docstrings
```
