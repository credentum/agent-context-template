## üìù Enhanced RCICO Prompt
**Role**
You are a senior software engineer enhancing the workflow automation system with hybrid sub-agent capabilities.

**Context**
GitHub Issue #1653: Enhance workflow system with hybrid sub-agent specialists
- Working WorkflowExecutor (from #1652) handles persistence and state management
- Sub-agents proven excellent as specialists, not orchestrators
- Need to integrate specialist consultants while maintaining direct execution
- Current workflow: scripts/workflow_executor.py, scripts/workflow_cli.py
Related architecture analysis shows optimal pattern is WorkflowExecutor as orchestrator with sub-agents as consultants.

**Instructions**
1. **Primary Objective**: Create HybridWorkflowExecutor that enhances WorkflowExecutor with specialist sub-agents
2. **Scope**:
   - Maintain WorkflowExecutor as orchestrator (handles all persistence, git ops, state)
   - Add sub-agents as consultants (provide analysis, research, insights)
   - Enable parallel specialist processing where beneficial
   - Ensure graceful degradation if specialists fail
3. **Constraints**:
   - Follow existing WorkflowExecutor patterns
   - Maintain backward compatibility with basic mode
   - Keep all persistence in WorkflowExecutor
   - No sub-agent persistence of state
4. **Prompt Technique**: Implementation with inheritance pattern
5. **Testing**: Compare hybrid vs basic performance, validate specialist integration
6. **Documentation**: Update workflow docs with hybrid capabilities

**Technical Constraints**
‚Ä¢ Expected diff ‚â§ 600 LoC, ‚â§ 6 files
‚Ä¢ Context budget: ‚â§ 15k tokens
‚Ä¢ Performance budget: Parallel specialists should improve speed
‚Ä¢ Code quality: Black formatting, coverage ‚â• 71.82%
‚Ä¢ CI compliance: All Docker CI checks must pass

**Output Format**
Return complete HybridWorkflowExecutor implementation with:
- Specialist integration for investigation, validation phases
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Fallback to basic mode on failure
- Tests demonstrating improvements
Use conventional commits: feat(workflow): add hybrid sub-agent specialist support

## üîç Verification & Testing
- `./scripts/run-ci-docker.sh` (Docker CI compliance)
- `pytest tests/test_hybrid_workflow.py` (hybrid execution tests)
- `python scripts/workflow_cli.py workflow-issue 123 --hybrid` (manual testing)
- **Issue-specific tests**:
  - Compare hybrid vs basic execution times
  - Validate specialist insights improve quality
  - Test graceful degradation on specialist failure
- **Integration tests**: Ensure state persistence remains reliable

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Sub-agents integrated as specialist consultants within WorkflowExecutor phases
- [x] Parallel sub-agent processing for research and analysis tasks
- [x] Enhanced investigation phase with issue-investigator specialist
- [x] Improved validation phase with test-runner and security-analyzer specialists
- [x] Context research capabilities using general-purpose agents
- [x] Workflow orchestration remains in WorkflowExecutor (no sub-agent persistence)
- [x] Performance improvement through parallel specialist analysis
- [x] Backward compatibility with basic WorkflowExecutor mode
