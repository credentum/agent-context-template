# Execution Plan: Issue #1243 - Consolidate and Review GitHub Actions Workflows

## Issue Reference
- **GitHub Issue**: [#1243](https://github.com/droter/agent-context-template/issues/1243)
- **Sprint Reference**: sprint-4-2, Phase 2: Implementation
- **Task Template**: `context/trace/task-templates/issue-1243-consolidate-review-github-actions-workflows.md`

## Analysis Summary
Issue #1243 requests consolidation and review of 29 GitHub Actions workflows to eliminate redundancy, conflicts, and false errors. This builds on the work from Issue #1063 which introduced unified CI patterns.

**Current State**:
- 29 total workflow files (8 disabled, 21 active)
- Significant redundancy in CI/testing workflows
- Multiple disabled legacy auto-merge workflows
- Related work in progress from Issue #1063 alignment

**Desired State**:
- Consolidated workflows with no redundancy
- Updated MIGRATION.md documentation
- Removed obsolete .disabled files
- Updated branch protection rules

## Token Budget & Complexity
- **Estimated tokens**: 8,000 (workflow review + consolidation)
- **Estimated time**: 2-3 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium - systematic workflow consolidation
- **Files affected**: ~15 workflow files + documentation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Workflow Audit and Analysis
1. **Systematic review** of all 29 workflow files
2. **Categorize workflows** by function (CI, testing, PR automation, etc.)
3. **Identify duplicates** and overlapping functionality
4. **Document findings** in structured format

### Phase 2: Consolidation Planning
1. **Group workflows** for consolidation opportunities
2. **Determine priority** based on complexity and impact
3. **Plan migration** strategy to avoid breaking changes
4. **Create consolidation** roadmap

### Phase 3: Implementation
1. **Remove obsolete** .disabled files
2. **Consolidate redundant** workflows
3. **Update MIGRATION.md** with changes
4. **Validate branch** protection compatibility

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation
1. **Test consolidated** workflows
2. **Update documentation** 
3. **Verify CI coverage** maintained
4. **Document migration** status

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Audit All Workflows
- Review each of 29 workflow files
- Categorize by purpose and identify duplicates
- Document current state and consolidation opportunities

### Step 2: Remove Obsolete Files
- Delete .disabled workflow files that are no longer needed
- Clean up legacy auto-merge workflows already replaced

### Step 3: Consolidate Overlapping Workflows
- Merge duplicate CI workflows (ci-optimized*, ci-unified)
- Consolidate test runners (test.yml, test-suite.yml, test-coverage.yml)
- Review PR automation workflows for overlap

### Step 4: Update Documentation
- Update MIGRATION.md with consolidation results
- Document active vs deprecated workflows
- Update branch protection guidance

## Success Criteria Validation
- [ ] All 29 workflows audited for redundancy and conflicts
- [ ] Obsolete/duplicate workflows identified and removed
- [ ] Overlapping functionality consolidated into unified workflows
- [ ] MIGRATION.md documents active vs deprecated workflows
- [ ] No regression in CI coverage or functionality
- [ ] Branch protection rules updated appropriately

## Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Most consolidation work already started in Issue #1063
- **Mitigation**: Follow existing patterns and preserve functionality
- **Main risk**: Breaking active PR status checks during consolidation
- **Mitigation**: Careful validation and incremental changes

## Related Context
- Issue #1063 scratchpad shows successful unified workflow patterns
- MIGRATION.md shows current consolidation status
- Existing claude-ci.sh delegation pattern to follow
