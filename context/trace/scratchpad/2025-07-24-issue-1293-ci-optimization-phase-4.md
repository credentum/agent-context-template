- **Component**: ci-workflows
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Task Template**: `/context/trace/task-templates/issue-1293-ci-migration-phase-4-optimization.md`

## Token Budget & Complexity
- **Estimated Tokens**: 50,000 (complex system integration)

## Context from Previous Phases
Based on Phase 3 scratchpad, the CI migration has progressed through:
- **Phase 1**: Local CI execution foundation
- **Phase 2**: Enhanced reliability and security
- **Phase 3**: Full migration with git hooks and workflow conversion
- **Phase 4** (Current): Performance optimization and advanced features

## Technical Architecture

### Caching Strategy
- **Content-addressable cache**: Hash-based storage for dependencies
- **Incremental artifacts**: Store compilation results by file hash
- **Distributed cache**: Redis backend for team sharing
- **Smart invalidation**: Change detection for cache cleanup

### Distributed Execution
- **Job scheduler**: Queue-based task distribution
- **Load balancer**: Distribute jobs based on runner capacity
- **Result aggregator**: Collect and merge results from multiple runners
- **Fault tolerance**: Retry failed jobs on different runners

### Incremental Builds
- **Dependency graph**: File-level dependency tracking
- **Change detection**: Git-based file change analysis
- **Language support**: Python, JavaScript, Docker, etc.
- **Artifact reuse**: Reuse previous build outputs

### Hardware Support
- **Capability detection**: Automatic GPU/CPU detection
- **Job routing**: Route jobs to appropriate hardware
- **Cost optimization**: Prefer cheaper hardware when possible
- **Specialized environments**: Support for specific test requirements

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Backward compatibility**: All features opt-in by default
2. **Graceful degradation**: Fall back to standard CI if optimization fails
3. **Performance monitoring**: Track improvement metrics continuously
4. **Emergency bypass**: Quick disable for all optimizations
5. **Incremental rollout**: Enable features gradually

## Performance Targets
- **Execution time**: >50% reduction target
- **Cache hit rate**: >80% for dependencies
- **Resource utilization**: Optimal across available runners
- **Cost reduction**: Lower overall CI cost through efficiency
