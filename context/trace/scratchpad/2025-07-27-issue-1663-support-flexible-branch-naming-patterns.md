- [x] Create trace files with schema_version header

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Existing Code Structure
```python
# Current workflow_validator.py implementation (lines ~246-255)
def _check_pr_created(self) -> bool:
    """Check if PR was created using hardcoded patterns."""
    # Current implementation only checks fix/ and feature/ patterns
    # Need to extend for flexible configuration
```

### Required Changes

#### 1. Configuration Schema (workflow-enforcement.yaml)
```yaml
# New branch_patterns section
validation:
  branch_patterns:
    # List of allowed prefixes
    prefixes:
      - "fix"
      - "feature"
      - "hotfix"
      - "refactor"
      - "chore"
      - "docs"
      - "style"
      - "test"

    # Optional custom regex pattern
    custom_regex: "^(fix|feature|hotfix)\\/\\d+-.+"

    # Security settings
    max_pattern_length: 1000
    allow_custom_regex: true
```

#### 2. Enhanced WorkflowValidator Class
```python
class WorkflowValidator:
    def __init__(self, config_path: str = None):
        # Load branch pattern configuration
        self.branch_config = self._load_branch_patterns()

    def _load_branch_patterns(self) -> dict:
        """Load and validate branch pattern configuration."""
        # Load from workflow-enforcement.yaml with safe defaults

    def _validate_custom_regex(self, pattern: str) -> bool:
        """Validate custom regex pattern for security."""
        # Prevent ReDoS attacks and validate format

    def _validate_branch_prefixes(self, prefixes: list) -> list:
        """Sanitize and validate branch prefixes."""
        # Remove dangerous characters and validate length

    def _check_pr_created(self) -> bool:
        """Check PR creation with flexible branch patterns."""
        # Use configuration-driven pattern matching
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. ReDoS Prevention
- Validate regex pattern complexity
- Limit pattern length (max 1000 characters)
- Detect dangerous patterns (nested quantifiers, excessive backtracking)
- Test compilation before use

### 2. Input Sanitization
- Sanitize branch prefixes (alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen only)
- Validate prefix length (1-50 characters)
- Type checking for all inputs
- Safe defaults when validation fails

### 3. Configuration Validation
- JSON/YAML parsing error handling
- Type validation for configuration values
- Graceful fallback to original behavior
- Logging of validation issues

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **ReDoS Attack Risk**: Custom regex patterns could cause catastrophic backtracking
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive regex validation and testing before use

2. **Backward Compatibility**: Changes could break existing workflows
   - *Mitigation*: Maintain fix/ and feature/ as defaults, extensive testing

3. **Configuration Errors**: Invalid YAML could crash validator
   - *Mitigation*: Robust error handling and safe fallback behavior

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Performance Impact**: Complex regex patterns could slow validation
   - *Mitigation*: Pattern complexity limits and caching

2. **Security Bypass**: Malicious patterns could bypass validation
   - *Mitigation*: Input sanitization and allowlist-based validation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test each branch pattern type individually
- Test custom regex pattern functionality
- Test security validation methods
- Test configuration loading and error handling
- Test backward compatibility scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Test full workflow with various branch patterns
- Test with real GitHub API responses
- Test configuration file loading from filesystem
- Test fallback behavior under error conditions

### Security Tests
- Test ReDoS prevention with malicious patterns
- Test input sanitization effectiveness
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test error handling with invalid inputs

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements
- [x] All existing fix/ and feature/ patterns continue to work
- [x] New branch patterns (hotfix/, refactor/, chore/, docs/, style/, test/) are supported
- [x] Custom regex patterns work for complex naming schemes
- [x] Configuration loads properly from workflow-enforcement.yaml
- [x] Graceful fallback when configuration is invalid or missing

### Security Requirements
- [x] Custom regex patterns are validated for ReDoS risks

### Final Implementation Summary
The flexible branch naming pattern support has been successfully implemented with:
1. Configurable branch prefixes with secure validation
2. Optional custom regex patterns with ReDoS prevention
3. Backward compatibility maintained
4. Comprehensive security measures implemented
5. Full test coverage achieved

## Notes & Observations

- The existing workflow validator is tightly coupled to fix/ and feature/ patterns
- Security is a primary concern due to custom regex support
- Backward compatibility is critical for existing workflows
- Configuration-driven approach provides maximum flexibility
- Comprehensive testing is essential due to security implications
- Successfully merged features from both development branches
