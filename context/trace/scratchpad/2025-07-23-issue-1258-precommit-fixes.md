# Execution Plan: Issue #1258 - Run Pre-commit and Fix All Violations

**Date**: 2025-07-23
**Issue**: #1258 - [SPRINT-4.2] Run Pre-commit on Entire Codebase and Fix All Violations
**Sprint**: sprint-4.2
**Task Template**: context/trace/task-templates/issue-1258-run-precommit-fix-violations.md

## Token Budget & Complexity Assessment
- **Estimated Tokens**: 15,000
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Time Estimate**: 1-2 hours
- **Risk**: Low (formatting changes only)

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### 1. Environment Setup & Initial Assessment
- [ ] Verify pre-commit is installed
- [ ] Run initial pre-commit check to assess violations
- [ ] Document violation types and file counts

### 2. Automated Fixes (Phase 1)
- [ ] Run Black formatter with --fix option
- [ ] Run isort with --fix option
- [ ] Run pre-commit-hooks auto-fixes (trailing whitespace, EOF)
- [ ] Commit automated fixes

### 3. Manual Fixes (Phase 2)
- [ ] Address flake8 violations that can't be auto-fixed
- [ ] Fix or appropriately ignore mypy type checking issues
- [ ] Handle any complex formatting issues

### 4. Validation
- [ ] Run `pre-commit run --all-files` until clean
- [ ] Run `./scripts/claude-ci.sh pre-commit`
- [ ] Run pytest to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Run full CI validation

### 5. Documentation & PR
- [ ] Update task template with actuals
- [ ] Create PR to unblock #1244
- [ ] Monitor PR through completion

## Expected Challenges
1. **Large number of files**: May need to process in batches
2. **MyPy issues**: Some may require `# type: ignore` with justification
3. **Context window**: May need to clear context between phases

## Success Metrics
- All pre-commit hooks pass
- No test regressions
- PR #1244 can merge after this fix
- CI pipeline fully green

## Notes
- This is a follow-up to #1256 where YAML issues were fixed
- Focus on formatting/style only - no functional changes
- Some files may legitimately need exclusion from certain checks
