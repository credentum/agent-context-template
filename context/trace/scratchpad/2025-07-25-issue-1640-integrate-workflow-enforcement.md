# Issue #1640 Execution Scratchpad
**Date**: 2025-07-25
**Issue**: [SPRINT-5.1] Integrate workflow enforcement system into workflow-issue command
**Sprint**: sprint-5-1
**Task Template**: [issue-1640-integrate-workflow-enforcement.md](../task-templates/issue-1640-integrate-workflow-enforcement.md)

## Token Budget & Complexity Assessment
- **Estimated Tokens**: 15,000 tokens
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium (integration task)
- **Files to Modify**: 3-5 files

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis Complete âœ…
- [x] Got issue details via `gh issue view 1640`
- [x] Located workflow-validator.py (enforcement system exists)
- [x] Analyzed current workflow structure
- [x] Created task template and scratchpad

### Phase 2: Implementation Strategy
1. **Identify Integration Points**
   - Find where agents are invoked in workflow-issue command
   - Locate workflow coordinator code
   - Map current agent delegation patterns

2. **Integration Implementation**
   - Add `enforce_workflow_phase()` calls before agent execution
   - Add `complete_workflow_phase()` calls after agent completion
   - Handle validation failures gracefully
   - Preserve state across agent executions

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test with actual workflow execution
   - Verify phase prerequisite validation
   - Test failure scenarios and recovery
   - Validate state persistence

### Phase 3: Key Files Analysis

#### Primary Integration Targets
- **workflow-issue command implementation** (need to locate)
- **.claude/workflows/workflow-issue.md** (documentation updates)
- **.claude/workflows/workflow-validator.py** (ensure completeness)

#### Supporting Files
- **Agent coordination code** (to be identified)
- **Test scripts** (create validation tests)

### Implementation Notes
- workflow-validator.py already has proper security validation
- Need to find actual workflow coordinator implementation
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Error messages should be clear and actionable

### Context Preservation Strategy
- Use task template as reference for prompt techniques
- Keep enforcement integration lightweight
- Preserve existing workflow phase structure
- Document all changes for maintainability

## Execution Log
- **10:30**: Started proper workflow execution after initial failure
- **10:35**: Located and analyzed workflow-validator.py
- **10:40**: Created task template and scratchpad files
- **Next**: Commit documentation and proceed to implementation
