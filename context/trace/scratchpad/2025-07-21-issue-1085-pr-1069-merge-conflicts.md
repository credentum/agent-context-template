# Execution Plan: Issue #1085 - PR #1069 Merge Conflicts

## Issue Link
- GitHub Issue: #1085 - [PR #1069] Resolve merge conflicts and update branch with main
- Task Template: context/trace/task-templates/issue-1085-pr-1069-merge-conflicts.md

## Token Budget & Complexity
- Estimated tokens: 10,000
- Complexity: Medium (merge conflict resolution)
- Time estimate: 30 minutes

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### 1. Pre-flight Checks
- [ ] Verify issue #1084 is resolved (coverage configuration) âœ“ CONFIRMED CLOSED
- [ ] Check current working directory is clean
- [ ] Ensure we're on main branch initially

### 2. Checkout PR Branch
- [ ] Fetch the PR branch: `git fetch origin feature/1057-auto-format-claude-edits`
- [ ] Checkout the branch: `git checkout feature/1057-auto-format-claude-edits`
- [ ] Verify branch status

### 3. Update Branch with Main
- [ ] Fetch latest main: `git fetch origin main`
- [ ] Attempt merge: `git merge origin/main`
- [ ] If conflicts, resolve them manually
- [ ] Key areas to check for conflicts:
  - Test files (bidirectional workflow tests)
  - Coverage configuration files (pyproject.toml, pytest.ini)

### 4. Resolve Conflicts
- [ ] Identify conflicting files
- [ ] For each conflict:
  - Understand both changes
  - Preserve PR's intent while incorporating main's updates
  - Ensure coverage configuration from #1084 is preserved
- [ ] Stage resolved files

### 5. Validate Changes Locally
- [ ] Run pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit run --all-files`
- [ ] Run Docker CI: `./scripts/run-ci-docker.sh`
- [ ] Run tests: `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing`
- [ ] Verify coverage doesn't drop

### 6. Update PR Description
- [ ] Use gh CLI to update PR description
- [ ] Change "Closes #1069" to "Closes #1057"
- [ ] Add note about conflict resolution

### 7. Push Updates
- [ ] Force push with lease: `git push --force-with-lease origin feature/1057-auto-format-claude-edits`
- [ ] Monitor CI checks in PR

### 8. Verify Success
- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] No merge conflicts shown
- [ ] PR is ready to merge

## Risk Mitigation
- If Docker CI fails locally, debug before pushing
- If conflicts are complex, may need to understand PR #1069's changes in detail
- Ensure we don't lose any of the original PR's fixes

## Notes
- PR #1069 is about handling closed issue #116 in bidirectional workflow tests
- The branch name suggests it's related to auto-formatting Claude edits (issue #1057)
- Coverage configuration issues should be resolved by #1084
