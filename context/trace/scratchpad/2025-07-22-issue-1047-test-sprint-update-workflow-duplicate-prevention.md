# Issue #1047: Test Sprint Update Workflow Duplicate Prevention

**Date**: 2025-07-22
**Issue**: https://github.com/agent-context-template/issues/1047
**Sprint**: sprint-4.1
**Phase**: Phase 9: Sprint Update Workflow Testing
**Task Template**: context/trace/task-templates/issue-1047-test-sprint-update-workflow-duplicate-prevention.md

## Token Budget & Complexity Assessment
- **Estimated tokens**: 15,000 tokens
- **Complexity**: Medium (testing existing functionality, validation-focused)
- **Files affected**: ~3 files (sprint YAML + test file + validation)
- **Time estimate**: 1-2 hours

## Understanding the Problem

From issue analysis and workflow examination:

### Original Problem:
- Sprint Update workflow created duplicate PRs #106 and #107
- Root cause: Both `pull_request.closed` and `issues.closed` events fired simultaneously
- When PR merged and auto-closed an issue, both events triggered the workflow

### Current Fix (in .github/workflows/sprint-update.yml):
1. **Concurrency Control** (lines 18-21): Prevents simultaneous runs for same issue/PR
2. **Duplicate Detection** (lines 38-87): Checks for recent/active runs
3. **Cancellation Logic** (lines 88-94): Exits if duplicate detected

### What We Need to Test:
1. Concurrency control works correctly
2. Duplicate detection logic functions properly
3. No duplicate PRs are created during simultaneous events
4. Normal workflow operation is not impacted
5. Edge cases and timing scenarios are handled

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis & Test Design
1. **Understand current workflow logic** - COMPLETED
   - Concurrency group: `sprint-update-${{ github.event.issue.number || github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}`
   - Duplicate detection looks for runs in last 2 hours
   - Cancels if successful run in last 5 minutes or active run detected

2. **Design test scenarios**:
   - Test Case 1: Normal operation (single event)
   - Test Case 2: Simultaneous PR close + issue close
   - Test Case 3: Multiple rapid workflow triggers
   - Test Case 4: Edge case timing scenarios

### Phase 2: Test Implementation
1. **Create comprehensive test file**: `tests/test_sprint_update_duplicate_prevention.py`
2. **Mock GitHub Actions environment** for testing concurrency logic
3. **Test duplicate detection algorithm** with various time scenarios
4. **Validate cancellation logic** works correctly

### Phase 3: Manual Validation
1. **Add this task to sprint YAML** (triggers issue creation from sprint system)
2. **Create PR that closes this issue** using "Closes #1047"
3. **Merge PR and monitor** Sprint Update workflow behavior
4. **Verify only one Sprint Update PR** is created
5. **Check workflow logs** for duplicate detection working

### Phase 4: Documentation & Reporting
1. **Update task template** with actual results
2. **Document test outcomes** and any findings
3. **Report validation results** back to issue

## Context Window Management
- Monitor token usage proactively
- Use `/clear` if approaching 25k tokens
- Reference task template for consistency
- Focus on concise, targeted testing

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite created for duplicate prevention
- [ ] All test scenarios pass in CI environment
- [ ] Manual validation: Only one Sprint Update PR created when merging PR that closes issue
- [ ] Workflow logs show duplicate detection logic activating correctly
- [ ] No regressions in normal Sprint Update workflow operation
- [ ] Coverage maintained above 71.82%

## Notes
- This is a validation task, not new feature development
- Focus on proving the existing fix works correctly
- Document any edge cases or recommendations for improvement
- Ensure tests can run reliably in CI environment
