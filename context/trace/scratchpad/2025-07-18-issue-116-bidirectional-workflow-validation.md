# Issue #116 Execution: Bidirectional Workflow Validation Test

**Issue URL**: https://github.com/credentum/agent-context-template/issues/116
**Sprint**: sprint-4.1
**Date**: 2025-07-18
**Priority**: High

## Execution Plan

### Current Status
- Issue #116 exists in GitHub
- Task exists in sprint-4.1.yaml Phase 8 but is not linked to GitHub issue
- Task template created: `context/trace/task-templates/issue-116-bidirectional-workflow-validation-test.md`

### Implementation Steps

1. **Link Task to Issue** (YAML→GitHub validation)
   - Run sprint issue linker sync to link existing task to issue #116
   - Verify sprint YAML gets updated with github_issue: 116

2. **Test Status Sync** (GitHub→YAML validation)
   - Temporarily change issue status and verify sync
   - Test both directions of status synchronization

3. **Test Label Sync** (Bidirectional validation)
   - Verify labels sync between sprint YAML and GitHub issue
   - Test adding/removing labels in both directions

4. **Test Orphan Handling** (Edge case validation)
   - Test task removal scenario (simulated, not actual removal)
   - Verify orphaned issue detection works

5. **Complete Test Scenarios**
   - Mark all test scenarios as completed
   - Document results in test log

### Token Budget Assessment
- Estimated: 5000 tokens (testing existing functionality)
- Complexity: Low (CLI tool execution and validation)
- Files affected: 3 (sprint yaml, test results, logs)

### Success Criteria
- All test scenarios in issue #116 marked as completed
- Bidirectional sync verified working
- GitHub issue #116 properly linked in sprint YAML
- Comprehensive test results documented
