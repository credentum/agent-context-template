- Task Template: context/trace/task-templates/issue-1062-update-claude-md-ci-workflow.md

## Sprint Reference
- Sprint: Not yet assigned (documentation enhancement)
- Component: documentation
- Priority: Medium

## Token Budget & Complexity Assessment
- Estimated tokens: 8,000
- Complexity: Medium (documentation update)
- Files affected: 1 (CLAUDE.md)
- Risk: Low (documentation only)

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Feature Branch
- Branch name: `docs/1062-claude-md-ci-workflow`
- Base: main branch

### 2. Update CLAUDE.md Structure
The updates will be made in the following order:

#### A. Add New CI Integration Section (after "Recommended Workflows")
- Create comprehensive "CI Integration for Claude Code" section
- Include quick reference table
- Add detailed command documentation
- Show expected JSON outputs

#### B. Update Existing Sections
1. **Recommended Workflows (Section 6)**
   - Already has basic claude-ci.sh mentions
   - Enhance with more detailed examples
   - Add workflow integration table

2. **CLI Cheat-Sheet (Section 4)**
   - Add CI commands to quick reference
   - Include most common CI operations

3. **Testing Workflow Subsection**
   - Update with new CI-first approach
   - Show progressive validation strategy

4. **Development Workflow Table**
   - Add CI checkpoints at each stage
   - Include specific commands

#### C. Add Troubleshooting Section
- Common CI errors and solutions
- How to parse JSON output
- Fix guidance for each tool

### 3. Content Structure

#### New Section Outline:
```
## ðŸ”§ CI Integration for Claude Code

### Quick Reference
[Table of common commands]

### CI Commands in Detail
- claude-ci check
- claude-ci test
- claude-ci pre-commit
- claude-ci review
- claude-ci all

### Progressive Validation Strategy
- Quick checks
- Standard validation
- Comprehensive review

### Integration with Development Workflow
[Updated workflow table]

### Troubleshooting CI Issues
[Common errors and fixes]
```

### 4. Implementation Details

#### Key Points to Cover:
1. **When to use each command** - Clear triggers for each CI tool
2. **Expected outputs** - JSON examples Claude can parse
3. **Error handling** - How to interpret and fix issues
4. **Workflow integration** - Natural fit into development flow
5. **Performance tips** - Quick vs comprehensive modes

#### Examples to Include:
- Post-edit validation workflow
- Pre-commit fix cycle
- Smart test selection
- Local PR review simulation

### 5. Verification Steps
- [ ] All command examples tested and accurate
- [ ] JSON outputs properly formatted
- [ ] Integration points clearly marked
- [ ] Troubleshooting covers common scenarios
- [ ] Document flows logically

## Dependencies
- CI scripts must be present: claude-ci.sh, claude-test-changed.sh, etc.
- Scripts should be executable and working
- Documentation should reflect actual tool behavior

## Risk Mitigation
- Low risk: Documentation only change
- Backup: Keep original sections intact, only add/enhance
- Testing: Verify all commands work as documented

## Next Steps
1. Commit task template and scratchpad
2. Create feature branch
3. Implement documentation updates
4. Test all examples
5. Create PR with comprehensive description
