# Execution Scratchpad: Issue #1649 - Workflow Issue Agent Persistence

**Date**: 2025-07-26
**Issue**: #1649 - Fix /workflow-issue command to properly delegate to sub-agents with persistent changes
**Sprint**: sprint-4.3
**Task Template**: [issue-1649-workflow-issue-agent-persistence.md](../task-templates/issue-1649-workflow-issue-agent-persistence.md)

## Token Budget & Complexity Assessment
- **Estimated Tokens**: 15,000 (High complexity architectural change)
- **Estimated Time**: 45 minutes
- **Complexity**: HIGH - Requires architectural redesign of workflow execution

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Analyze Current Implementation âœ“
- workflow_cli.py uses Task() tool for agent delegation
- Agents run in isolated environments
- Changes don't persist to main repository
- Root cause: Task tool creates temporary contexts

### Step 2: Design Solution
**Option A**: Direct execution in main context (SELECTED)
- Modify workflow_cli.py to execute phases directly
- Remove agent delegation for execution phases
- Keep agent delegation only for planning/analysis if needed
- Ensure all changes happen in main repository context

**Option B**: Create synchronization mechanism
- Complex and error-prone
- Would require significant Task tool modifications

### Step 3: Implementation Steps
1. Create workflow_executor.py with direct phase execution
2. Modify workflow_cli.py to use executor instead of Task delegation
3. Update workflow-issue.md command documentation
4. Test with actual issue execution

### Step 4: Key Changes

#### workflow_executor.py (NEW)
- Direct implementations of each phase
- File operations in main context
- Git operations that persist
- State management that works

#### workflow_cli.py (MODIFY)
- Replace Task() calls with direct executor calls
- Keep enforcement hooks
- Maintain phase structure
- Ensure state persistence

#### workflow-issue.md (UPDATE)
- Document new execution model
- Explain why direct execution is used
- Update examples

### Step 5: Testing Strategy
1. Create test issue
2. Run /workflow-issue command
3. Verify:
   - Task template created and persists
   - Git branch created and persists
   - Changes committed
   - PR actually created on GitHub
   - State file maintained throughout

## Progress Notes

### 2025-07-26 20:25
- Created feature branch: fix/1649-workflow-issue-agent-persistence
- Created task template with detailed implementation plan
- Identified root cause: Task tool isolation
- Selected direct execution approach as solution

### Implementation Status
- [ ] Create workflow_executor.py
- [ ] Modify workflow_cli.py
- [ ] Update command documentation
- [ ] Test with real issue
- [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria

## Lessons Learned
- Agent delegation via Task() is suitable for analysis/planning but not for execution
- Direct execution in main context is required for persistent changes
- Workflow enforcement can still work with direct execution

## Token Usage Tracking
- Phase 0 (Investigation): ~2000 tokens
- Phase 1 (Planning): ~3000 tokens
- Phase 2 (Implementation): TBD
- Phase 3 (Testing): TBD
- Phase 4 (PR Creation): TBD
- Phase 5 (Monitoring): TBD
