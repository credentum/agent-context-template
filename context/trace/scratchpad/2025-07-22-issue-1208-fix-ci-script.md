# Execution Plan: Issue #1208 - Fix Local CI Script

**Date**: 2025-07-22
**Issue**: #1208 - [SPRINT-4.2] Fix Local CI Script to Run All Checks Despite Failures
**Sprint**: sprint-4.2
**Task Template**: context/trace/task-templates/issue-1208-fix-local-ci-script.md

## Token Budget & Complexity Assessment
- **Estimated Tokens**: 5k (single file modification)
- **Complexity**: Low - bash script error handling refactor
- **Risk**: Low - enhancing existing functionality

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### 1. Analysis Phase
- [x] Understand current script behavior with `set -e`
- [x] Identify all check locations using run_check()
- [x] Review error handling and summary logic

### 2. Implementation Steps
1. **Remove `set -e` directive** (line 5)
   - This stops the script from exiting on first error
   
2. **Modify run_check() function** (lines 24-46)
   - Already tracks failures with FAILED counter
   - Already returns proper exit codes
   - No changes needed here!

3. **Ensure proper error propagation**
   - Script already exits with code 1 on failures (line 172)
   - Summary already shows failed checks (lines 159-173)

4. **Test error collection**
   - The current logic should work once `set -e` is removed
   - Each run_check() call continues regardless of failure

### 3. Testing Plan
1. Create intentional errors:
   ```bash
   # Add long line to trigger flake8 E501
   echo "# This is a very long line that exceeds the maximum line length and will trigger flake8 E501 error for testing purposes only" >> src/test_file.py
   
   # Add formatting issue for Black
   echo "x=1+2" >> src/test_file.py
   ```

2. Run the script and verify:
   - Both errors are detected
   - Script continues after Black failure
   - Summary shows both failures

3. Clean up test files

### 4. Key Observations
- The script is already well-designed for collecting multiple failures
- The only issue is `set -e` causing early exit
- Removing `set -e` should be sufficient to fix the issue
- The run_check() function and summary logic are already correct

### 5. Additional Improvements (Optional)
- Could add parallel execution for faster feedback
- Could enhance summary with specific error counts
- But these are beyond the scope of this issue

## Execution Log
- Starting implementation...
- Removed `set -e` from line 5
- No other changes needed - the script already has proper error collection!
- Testing with intentional errors...

## Results
- Solution is simpler than expected
- Single line change fixes the issue
- Error collection logic was already properly implemented
