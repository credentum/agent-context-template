# Issue 39: Test Coverage Uplift Implementation Plan

**Issue Link**: https://github.com/droter/agent-context-template/issues/39
**Sprint**: sprint-5
**Status**: In Progress

## Current State Analysis

### Coverage Metrics (Current):
- Line Coverage: 78.65%
- Branch Coverage: Currently not enforced in CI
- Mutation Testing: Not enforced with baseline

### Target Metrics:
- Line Coverage: ≥80%
- Branch Coverage: ≥60%
- Mutation Testing: ≥20%

### Gap Analysis:
- Line Coverage: Need 1.35% increase (78.65% → 80%)
- Branch Coverage: Need to implement enforcement
- Mutation Testing: Need to establish 20% baseline

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Configuration Updates
1. **Update .coverage-config.json** with new targets:
   - baseline: 78.5% → 80%
   - Add branch_coverage: 60%
   - Add mutation_baseline: 20%

2. **Update scripts/coverage_summary.py** targets:
   - line_coverage: 49% → 80%
   - branch_coverage: 35% → 60%
   - mutation_score: 75% → 20%

3. **Update pyproject.toml** coverage configuration:
   - Ensure branch coverage is properly configured

### Phase 2: CI Integration
1. **GitHub Actions Workflow Updates**:
   - Ensure test-coverage.yml enforces new thresholds
   - Add proper error handling for coverage failures
   - Implement mutation testing baseline check

2. **Local CI Script Updates**:
   - Update scripts/run-ci-docker.sh to include coverage checks
   - Add mutation testing to CI pipeline

### Phase 3: Documentation Updates
1. **Update CLAUDE.md** with new coverage targets
2. **Update documentation** about coverage requirements
3. **Update sync scripts** to maintain consistency

## Technical Implementation Details

### Coverage Configuration Files:
- `.coverage-config.json`: Centralized configuration
- `pyproject.toml`: Tool configuration
- `pytest.ini`: Test configuration
- `scripts/coverage_summary.py`: Enforcement logic

### Mutation Testing:
- Use mutmut tool already configured in pyproject.toml
- Set baseline to 20% for critical modules
- Focus on src/validators/ and src/storage/ modules

### CI Pipeline:
- Fail CI if coverage drops below thresholds
- Generate coverage reports for PRs
- Update coverage badges automatically

## Testing Strategy

### Before Implementation:
- Run current test suite to establish baseline
- Verify all existing tests pass
- Document current coverage state

### During Implementation:
- Test each configuration change individually
- Verify CI pipeline changes work correctly
- Ensure local and remote CI consistency

### After Implementation:
- Run full test suite with new thresholds
- Verify coverage enforcement works
- Test mutation testing baseline

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues:
1. **Coverage drops below 80%**: May need to write additional tests
2. **Branch coverage too low**: May need to add edge case tests
3. **Mutation testing failures**: May need to strengthen assertions

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. Implement incrementally to isolate issues
2. Have fallback configuration ready
3. Focus on critical modules first

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `pytest --cov` shows ≥80% line coverage
- [ ] `pytest --cov-branch` shows ≥60% branch coverage
- [ ] Mutation testing shows ≥20% baseline
- [ ] CI fails when coverage drops below thresholds
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] Coverage reports are generated correctly

## Next Actions

1. Create feature branch: `fix/39-coverage-thresholds`
2. Update configuration files
3. Test changes locally
4. Update CI workflows
5. Run full test suite
6. Create PR with results
