- **Complexity**: Low - formatting fixes only
- **Time Estimate**: 30-60 minutes

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### 1. Setup and Initial Assessment
- [X] Switch to feature branch for issue #1244 (where issues exist)
- [X] Identify specific pre-commit failures from CI logs
- [ ] Run pre-commit locally to reproduce issues

### 2. Fix YAML Issues in Workflows
- [ ] Fix yamllint issues in ci-unified.yml (line length, trailing spaces)
- [ ] Fix any other workflow YAML issues
- [ ] Verify with yamllint

### 3. Fix Python Code Issues (if any)
- [ ] Run Black formatter on Python files
- [ ] Run isort on Python imports
- [ ] Fix any flake8 violations
- [ ] Address mypy type checking issues

### 4. Run Comprehensive Validation
- [ ] Run `pre-commit run --all-files`
- [ ] Run `./scripts/claude-ci.sh pre-commit`
- [ ] Run Docker CI to ensure everything passes
- [ ] Verify PR #1244 CI checks start passing

### 5. Commit and Push Fixes
- [ ] Commit formatting fixes with appropriate message
- [ ] Push to feature/1243-consolidate-workflows branch
- [ ] Monitor CI to ensure all checks pass

## Known Issues to Fix
From previous analysis:
1. YAML line length violations (>80 chars)
2. Trailing spaces in workflow files
3. Pre-commit hooks failing in Quick Validation stage

## Success Metrics
- All pre-commit checks pass
- CI pipeline (Quick Validation) succeeds
- PR #1244 becomes unblocked and can merge
