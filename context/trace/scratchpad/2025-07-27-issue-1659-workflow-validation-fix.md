# Scratchpad: Issue #1659 - Workflow Validation Fix

## Issue Analysis
The workflow-issue --hybrid command fails because Phase 1 validation expects planning documents to already exist, but Phase 1 is supposed to CREATE these documents.

## Root Cause
In `workflow_executor.py`, the `execute_planning` method only checks if files exist (lines 144-145, 156) but doesn't create them. It then returns `documentation_committed` based on whether commits exist (line 182).

## Solution Approach
1. Modify `execute_planning` in workflow_executor.py to:
   - Actually create the task template with proper content
   - Actually create the scratchpad with proper content
   - Stage and commit these files
   - Then return success

2. The validation logic in workflow_enforcer.py and agent_hooks.py is correct - it's checking outputs after phase completion, which is proper.

## Implementation Plan
1. Update workflow_executor.py execute_planning method
2. Add proper file creation logic with content
3. Add git operations to commit the files
4. Update tests to verify behavior
5. Test the complete workflow

## Testing Strategy
- Unit test for execute_planning to verify file creation
- Integration test for full workflow execution
- Manual test with issue 9999 to verify no validation errors
