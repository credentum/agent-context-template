# Execution Scratchpad: Issue #1656 - Docker Container Cleanup

**Date**: 2025-07-27
**Issue**: #1656 - Fix Docker container and test process cleanup issues
**Sprint**: sprint-current
**Task Template**: context/trace/task-templates/issue-1656-docker-container-cleanup.md

## Token Budget & Complexity Assessment
- **Estimated Tokens**: 15,000 (4 files, mostly configuration changes)
- **Complexity**: Medium (signal handling and Docker configuration)
- **Risk Level**: Low (infrastructure changes, no business logic impact)

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning âœ…
1. Retrieved issue #1656 details
2. Analyzed current test scripts and Docker configuration
3. Identified 4 files requiring changes:
   - scripts/test-comprehensive-ci.sh (no signal handling)
   - scripts/test-suite-like-ci.sh (has set -e but no cleanup)
   - docker-compose.ci.yml (missing stop signals)
   - Dockerfile.ci (no init system)
4. Created task template with implementation strategy

### Phase 2: Implementation (Current)
1. Add signal handling to test scripts:
   - Trap SIGTERM, SIGINT, EXIT signals
   - Kill child processes on cleanup
   - Use process groups for better management

2. Update Dockerfile.ci:
   - Install tini as lightweight init system
   - Configure as entrypoint for PID 1 handling

3. Update docker-compose.ci.yml:
   - Add stop_signal: SIGTERM to all services
   - Add stop_grace_period: 30s for graceful shutdown

4. Test signal handling and cleanup behavior

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- Run Docker containers and test Ctrl+C handling
- Verify no orphaned processes after tests
- Check Docker cleanup is complete
- Run full CI suite to ensure no regressions

### Phase 4: PR Creation
- Create PR with clear description of fixes
- Reference issue #1656
- Include testing instructions

## Implementation Notes

### Signal Handling Pattern
```bash
cleanup() {
    echo "Caught signal, cleaning up..."
    # Kill all child processes
    jobs -p | xargs -r kill 2>/dev/null
    # Wait for processes to exit
    wait
    exit 0
}
trap cleanup EXIT SIGTERM SIGINT
```

### Docker Init System
Using tini is recommended over docker --init flag for consistency across environments.

### Process Group Management
Consider using `setsid` for test runners to create new process groups.
