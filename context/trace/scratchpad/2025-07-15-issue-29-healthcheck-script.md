# Issue #29: Add infra/healthcheck.sh smoke test

**Issue Link**: https://github.com/droter/agent-context-template/issues/29
**Sprint**: sprint-4.1 (Phase 2: Health Check Implementation)
**Priority**: High
**Component**: infra

## Problem Analysis

The infrastructure stack (Qdrant v1.14.x and Neo4j 5.20) is already set up via issue #28, but needs a proper health check script that:
1. Properly exits with status codes (0 for success, non-zero for failure)
2. Validates both services are functional, not just running
3. Uses the Neo4j Python driver for proper connectivity testing
4. Follows the specific API endpoints as specified in acceptance criteria

## Current State Assessment

✅ **Already Complete:**
- `infra/docker-compose.yml` exists with proper service definitions
- Both services have Docker health checks configured
- `Makefile` has basic `make up`, `make down`, and `make health` targets

❌ **Missing/Needs Fix:**
- `infra/healthcheck.sh` script doesn't exist
- Current `make health` is rudimentary and doesn't exit with proper status codes
- `neo4j` Python driver not in `requirements-dev.txt`
- CONTRIBUTING.md missing infrastructure setup instructions

## Detailed Requirements from Issue

1. **Script Requirements:**
   - File: `infra/healthcheck.sh`
   - Must exit 0 on healthy stack, non-zero on failure
   - Must be executable (`chmod +x`)

2. **Health Checks:**
   - Qdrant: `curl localhost:6333/collections` should return `[]`
   - Neo4j: Python driver connectivity test using `GraphDatabase.driver('bolt://localhost:7687').verify_connectivity()`

3. **Dependencies:**
   - Add `neo4j` to `requirements-dev.txt`

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update CONTRIBUTING.md with run instructions

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Add Neo4j Driver Dependency
- Add `neo4j>=5.0.0` to `requirements-dev.txt`

### Step 2: Create Health Check Script
- Create `infra/healthcheck.sh` with proper error handling
- Test Qdrant API endpoint with exact response validation
- Test Neo4j connectivity using Python driver
- Ensure script exits with proper status codes
- Make executable with `chmod +x`

### Step 3: Update Makefile Integration
- Current `make health` target works but uses docker exec
- Should probably keep current approach OR call the new script
- Need to decide: replace current target or add new one?

### Step 4: Update Documentation
- Add infrastructure setup section to CONTRIBUTING.md
- Include prerequisites, startup, and health check instructions

### Step 5: Test and Validate
- Test script with services running
- Test script with services stopped (should fail appropriately)
- Verify Makefile integration works
- Ensure all CI checks pass

## Technical Considerations

1. **Dependency Management**: The Neo4j driver adds a significant dependency. Need to ensure it's only in dev requirements.

2. **Error Handling**: Script must handle various failure modes:
   - Services not running
   - Services running but not ready
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Invalid responses

3. **Timeout Handling**: Should include reasonable timeouts for both checks

4. **Python Environment**: Script needs to handle cases where Python environment might not be activated

## Expected Outcomes

After completion:
- `./scripts/run-ci-docker.sh` should pass
- `make up && make health` should work reliably
- `infra/healthcheck.sh` should be usable standalone
- Development workflow documented clearly
- Sprint goal #2 marked as completed

## Implementation Results

✅ **Successfully Completed** (2025-07-15)

All acceptance criteria met:
- [x] `infra/healthcheck.sh` exits 0 on healthy stack, non-zero on failures
- [x] Script checks Qdrant collections endpoint (`curl localhost:6333/collections` → `[]`)
- [x] Script checks Neo4j connectivity using Python driver (`GraphDatabase.driver().verify_connectivity()`)
- [x] Neo4j driver (`neo4j>=5.0.0`) added to `requirements-dev.txt`
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md updated with infrastructure setup instructions

### Technical Implementation
- **Branch**: `fix/29-healthcheck-script`
- **Initial Commit**: `9bccf6b` - feat(infra): add healthcheck.sh script for Qdrant and Neo4j
- **Final Commit**: `6f9f706` - feat(infra): implement PR review feedback for healthcheck script
- **PR**: #54 - https://github.com/credentum/agent-context-template/pull/54
- **Files Modified**: 10 files, +908/-239 lines

### Testing Verification
- ✅ Services running: Exit code 0, both services report healthy
- ✅ Services stopped: Exit code 1, proper error reporting
- ✅ Help command: `./infra/healthcheck.sh --help` works correctly
- ✅ CI checks: All lint checks pass (`./scripts/run-ci-docker.sh`)
- ✅ Pre-commit: All hooks pass with minor auto-fixes applied

### Script Features
- Comprehensive error handling and user-friendly output
- Colored terminal output with clear status indicators
- Proper exit codes for different failure scenarios
- Help documentation with usage examples
- Support for both `python` and `python3` commands
- Graceful handling of missing dependencies

### ARC-Reviewer Feedback Implementation ✅
Based on automated code review feedback, implemented all suggested follow-ups:

1. **✅ Integration Tests Added**: Comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_healthcheck_integration.py`
   - 15 tests covering script functionality, error handling, environment variables
   - Tests for concurrent execution, missing dependencies, and live service validation

2. **✅ Multi-Environment Support**: Parameterized host/port configuration
   - Environment variables: `QDRANT_HOST`, `QDRANT_PORT`, `NEO4J_HOST`, `NEO4J_PORT`, `CURL_TIMEOUT`
   - Supports remote services and custom timeouts
   - Enhanced help documentation with examples

3. **✅ CI Pipeline Integration**: Added to Vector and Graph Database Sync workflow
   - Fixed version mismatches between CI and local compose (Qdrant v1.14.0 → v1.14.1)
   - Aligned health check endpoints (`/health` → `/collections`)
   - Added comprehensive infrastructure validation step

4. **✅ Additional Robustness Improvements**:
   - Timeout flags for curl commands
   - Improved Python command detection logic
   - Better error messages and user feedback

### CI Error Resolution Process 🔧

**Original Error**: Vector and Graph Database Sync workflow failing with container startup errors

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Health check failure**: GitHub Actions service containers don't include `curl` for health checks
2. **Authentication mismatch**: CI uses `NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/testpassword` but script assumed no auth

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Removed health checks** from service containers (curl not available in GitHub runners)
2. **Enhanced wait step** with better error handling and 60-attempt timeout
3. **Added Neo4j authentication support** to healthcheck script with `NEO4J_USER`/`NEO4J_PASSWORD` env vars
4. **Updated CI workflow** to pass authentication credentials to healthcheck step

**Current Status**: Testing authentication fix via workflow trigger
