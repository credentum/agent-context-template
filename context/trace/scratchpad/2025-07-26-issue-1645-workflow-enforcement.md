# Scratchpad: Issue #1645 - Workflow Enforcement Implementation

**Date**: 2025-07-26
**Issue**: [#1645](https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/1645) - [SPRINT-4.2] Implement standard workflow enforcement for all issue resolutions
**Sprint**: sprint-4.2
**Task Template**: [issue-1645-workflow-enforcement.md](../task-templates/issue-1645-workflow-enforcement.md)

## Execution Plan

### Overview
Implement a comprehensive workflow enforcement system that ensures all issue resolutions follow the standard workflow documented in `.claude/workflows/workflow-issue.md`. This is critical because recent executions have shown that workflow steps are being skipped.

### Token Budget & Complexity Assessment
- **Estimated Tokens**: 30,000 (High complexity due to multiple integrations)
- **Estimated Time**: 6 hours
- **Complexity**: High - Requires integration with multiple agent types and state management

### Implementation Steps

1. **Core Enforcement Module** (2 hours)
   - Create `scripts/workflow_enforcer.py` with WorkflowEnforcer class
   - Implement phase validation logic
   - Add state persistence mechanism
   - Create configuration loading

2. **Agent Integration Hooks** (1.5 hours)
   - Create `scripts/agent_hooks.py` with pre/post phase hooks
   - Define hook interface for all agent types
   - Implement context updates and validation

3. **CLI Enhancement** (1 hour)
   - Create `scripts/workflow_cli.py` with enforcement commands
   - Add `workflow issue`, `workflow enforce`, and `workflow status` commands
   - Integrate with existing workflow commands

4. **Validator Integration** (30 minutes)
   - Update `scripts/validators/workflow_validator.py`
   - Connect to enforcement engine
   - Add phase transition validation

5. **Configuration** (30 minutes)
   - Create `.claude/config/workflow-enforcement.yaml`
   - Define phase requirements and rules
   - Set up default configuration

6. **Testing** (1 hour)
   - Create comprehensive test suites
   - Test enforcement logic
   - Test agent integration
   - Test state persistence

7. **Documentation** (30 minutes)
   - Create `.claude/guides/workflow-enforcement.md`
   - Update workflow documentation
   - Add troubleshooting guide

### Key Design Decisions

1. **State Persistence**: Use YAML files for human readability
2. **Hook Architecture**: Decorator pattern for minimal agent changes
3. **Configuration**: YAML-based for easy modification
4. **Error Handling**: Fail-safe with clear messages
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Enforcement can be disabled

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Performance Impact**: Keep validation lightweight (<100ms)
2. **Agent Compatibility**: Test with all agent types
3. **State Corruption**: Include recovery mechanisms
4. **User Experience**: Clear error messages with solutions

### Success Metrics

- All workflow phases have enforcement
- State persists across executions
- Clear error messages guide users
- Test coverage >95% for enforcement code
- CI passes with all checks

## Progress Tracking

- [ ] Task template created
- [ ] Scratchpad created
- [ ] Documentation committed
- [ ] Branch created
- [ ] Core enforcer implemented
- [ ] Agent hooks implemented
- [ ] CLI created
- [ ] Tests written
- [ ] CI passed

## Notes

- The irony of implementing workflow enforcement without following the workflow has been noted
- This implementation will prevent such violations in the future
- Focus on making enforcement helpful, not obstructive
