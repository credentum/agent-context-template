# Implementation Plan for Issue #1704

**Title**: [SPRINT-4.2] Fix workflow phase runner state synchronization failure
**Generated**: 2025-08-01T19:59:43.473436

## Subtasks Identified:
1. PhaseRunner and WorkflowEnforcer use synchronized state management
2. Workflows complete all phases without manual state file editing
3. Phase completion is properly tracked across both systems
4. No false failures when work is actually completed
5. Backward compatibility with existing workflows

## Next Steps:
1. Review the task template for specific requirements
2. Implement each subtask following the project patterns
3. Add appropriate tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed

Note: This is a placeholder implementation. The generic task execution
will be enhanced in future iterations.
