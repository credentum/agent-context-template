Issue Title: [SPRINT-4.2] Fix workflow validation phase timeout for full CI execution

Problem Description:
The workflow validation phase (Phase 3) is timing out after 90 seconds when running full CI checks. The full CI suite requires approximately 12 minutes to complete, but the phase runner has a 90-second timeout configured in `WorkflowConfig.PHASE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Modify validation phase to handle long-running CI operations
- [ ] Implement a validation-specific timeout of at least 15 minutes
- [ ] Ensure validation phase can complete full CI suite without timing out
- [ ] Add progress reporting during long CI operations
- [ ] Document the validation phase timeout configuration
- [ ] Ensure other phases maintain their shorter timeouts

Task Template Location: /workspaces/agent-context-template/worktree/issue-1711/context/trace/task-templates/issue-1711-sprint-42-fix-workflow-validation-phase-timeout-fo.md

Instructions:
1. Analyze the issue requirements and acceptance criteria carefully
2. Identify the files that need to be modified based on the problem description
3. Implement the necessary code changes following existing patterns
4. Create meaningful commits with proper conventional commit messages
5. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
6. Add appropriate error handling where needed

Important:
- Follow the existing code style and patterns in the repository
- Make minimal changes necessary to fix the issue
- Do not modify unrelated code or files
- Test your changes conceptually to ensure they work
- Use conventional commit format: type(scope): description

Please implement the required changes now.

## Implementation Status:
The workflow executor has been updated to use the Task tool for actual code implementation.
This plan serves as a record of the implementation approach.

## Next Steps:
1. The Task tool will analyze the codebase
2. Identify files to modify based on requirements
3. Apply the necessary code changes
4. Create appropriate commits

Note: Full automation requires Task tool integration in the workflow executor.
