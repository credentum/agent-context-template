# Implementation Plan for Issue #1694

**Title**: [SPRINT-TEST] Verify hybrid workflow resilience and phase completion
**Generated**: 2025-07-31T21:34:48.782252

## Subtasks Identified:
1. Add a simple utility function `format_workflow_status()` to `scripts/workflow_utils.py`
2. Function should format workflow phase status with timestamp and phase name
3. Include proper type hints and docstring
4. Add unit tests in `tests/test_workflow_utils.py` with at least 3 test cases
5. Verify all 6 workflow phases (0-5) execute without timing out
6. Confirm workflow stays in hybrid mode throughout execution
7. Validate proper error handling if any phase encounters issues

## Next Steps:
1. Review the task template for specific requirements
2. Implement each subtask following the project patterns
3. Add appropriate tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed

Note: This is a placeholder implementation. The generic task execution
will be enhanced in future iterations.
