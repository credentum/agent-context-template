Issue Title: [SPRINT-4.2] Create end-to-end workflow pipeline test suite

Problem Description:
The workflow pipeline bug discovered in #1706 (where only documentation was created instead of actual code) highlights the need for comprehensive end-to-end testing of the entire workflow pipeline. We need automated tests that verify each phase produces expected outputs and the complete pipeline works correctly.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create `tests/test_workflow_pipeline_e2e.py` with the following test scenarios:
  - [ ] Test simple code addition (add a function to existing file)
  - [ ] Test new file creation (create module with functions and tests)
  - [ ] Test code modification (update existing function logic)
  - [ ] Test bug fix scenario (fix a specific issue in code)
  - [ ] Test documentation-only changes (ensure these are handled differently)
- [ ] Create mock issue templates in `tests/fixtures/workflow_test_issues/`:
  - [ ] `simple_function_addition.json`
  - [ ] `new_module_creation.json`
  - [ ] `bug_fix_scenario.json`
- [ ] Implement verification helpers:
  - [ ] `assert_code_files_created(files: List[str])` - Verify specific files exist
  - [ ] `assert_implementation_matches_requirements(issue_data: dict)` - Check implementation
  - [ ] `assert_commits_contain_code_changes()` - Verify real commits made
  - [ ] `assert_no_documentation_only_implementation()` - Catch the #1706 bug
- [ ] Add workflow simulation utilities:
  - [ ] `simulate_workflow_execution(issue_number: int)` - Run workflow in test mode
  - [ ] `create_test_issue(template: str) -> int` - Create temporary test issues
- [ ] Document test execution and debugging procedures

Task Template Location: /workspaces/agent-context-template/worktree/issue-1710/context/trace/task-templates/issue-1710-sprint-42-create-end-to-end-workflow-pipeline-test.md

Instructions:
1. Analyze the issue requirements and acceptance criteria carefully
2. Identify the files that need to be modified based on the problem description
3. Implement the necessary code changes following existing patterns
4. Create meaningful commits with proper conventional commit messages
5. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
6. Add appropriate error handling where needed

Important:
- Follow the existing code style and patterns in the repository
- Make minimal changes necessary to fix the issue
- Do not modify unrelated code or files
- Test your changes conceptually to ensure they work
- Use conventional commit format: type(scope): description

Please implement the required changes now.

## Implementation Status:
The workflow executor has been updated to use the Task tool for actual code implementation.
This plan serves as a record of the implementation approach.

## Next Steps:
1. The Task tool will analyze the codebase
2. Identify files to modify based on requirements
3. Apply the necessary code changes
4. Create appropriate commits

Note: Full automation requires Task tool integration in the workflow executor.
