## Task Tool Prompt:
You are implementing code changes for GitHub Issue #1708.

Issue Title: [SPRINT-4.2-TEST] Validate workflow implementation creates actual code changes

Problem Description:
We need to verify that the workflow implementation phase:
1. Actually creates/modifies code files
2. Implements the requested functionality
3. Creates meaningful commits with real code changes
4. Properly reports implementation status

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create a new utility module `scripts/workflow_test_utils.py` with the following functions:
  - [ ] `validate_implementation_phase(issue_number: int) -> bool` - Checks if real code changes were made
  - [ ] `count_code_commits(branch_name: str) -> int` - Counts commits with actual code changes
  - [ ] `verify_task_completion(task_template_path: Path) -> Dict[str, bool]` - Verifies acceptance criteria
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_workflow_test_utils.py`:
  - [ ] Test normal operation of all three functions
  - [ ] Test edge cases (missing files, invalid inputs)
  - [ ] Test integration with workflow executor
- [ ] Add docstrings with examples for each function
- [ ] Ensure type hints are complete and accurate
- [ ] All tests must pass with >80% coverage for the new module

Task Template Location: /workspaces/agent-context-template/worktree/issue-1708/context/trace/task-templates/issue-1708-sprint-42-test-validate-workflow-implementation-cr.md

Instructions:
1. Analyze the issue requirements and acceptance criteria carefully
2. Identify the files that need to be modified based on the problem description
3. Implement the necessary code changes following existing patterns
4. Create meaningful commits with proper conventional commit messages
5. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
6. Add appropriate error handling where needed

Important:
- Follow the existing code style and patterns in the repository
- Make minimal changes necessary to fix the issue
- Do not modify unrelated code or files
- Test your changes conceptually to ensure they work
- Use conventional commit format: type(scope): description

Please implement the required changes now.

## Implementation Status:
The workflow executor has been updated to use the Task tool for actual code implementation.
This plan serves as a record of the implementation approach.

## Next Steps:
1. The Task tool will analyze the codebase
2. Identify files to modify based on requirements
3. Apply the necessary code changes
4. Create appropriate commits

Note: Full automation requires Task tool integration in the workflow executor.
