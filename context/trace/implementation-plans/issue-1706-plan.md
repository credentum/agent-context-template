# Implementation Plan for Issue #1706

**Title**: [SPRINT-4.2] Fix workflow executor implementation phase to execute actual code changes
**Generated**: 2025-08-01T20:42:53.278198

## Subtasks Identified:
1. Implementation phase reads task templates and executes code changes
2. Real code modifications are made based on issue requirements
3. Commits contain actual implementation, not just documentation
4. Proper error handling when implementation fails
5. Works for all issue types, not just special cases

## Next Steps:
1. Review the task template for specific requirements
2. Implement each subtask following the project patterns
3. Add appropriate tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed

Note: This is a placeholder implementation. The generic task execution
will be enhanced in future iterations.
