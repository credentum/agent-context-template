# Streamlined GitHub Workflows

This document explains the workflow optimization performed to reduce complexity and maintenance overhead.

## Summary of Changes

**Before**: 20 active workflows
**After**: 10 essential workflows
**Reduction**: 50% fewer workflows to maintain

## Active Workflows (Essential)

### Core CI/CD (4)
1. **test.yml** - Basic test runner for every push/PR
2. **test-coverage.yml** - Coverage tracking and reporting
3. **lint-verification.yml** - Code quality (Black, flake8, MyPy)
4. **claude-code-review.yml** - AI-powered code review

### PR Management (4)
5. **ai-pr-monitor.yml** - Comprehensive PR automation (replaces 5 legacy workflows)
6. **pr-issue-validation.yml** - Ensures PRs properly link to issues
7. **pr-conflict-validator.yml** - Conflict detection and warnings
8. **auto-close-issues.yml** - Auto-closes issues when PRs merge

### Assistant & Project Management (2)
9. **claude.yml** - Interactive Claude assistant (@claude mentions)
10. **sprint-update.yml** - Sprint progress tracking

## Disabled Workflows (Non-Essential)

### Redundant/Superseded
- `ai-pr-monitor-minimal.yml.disabled` - Minimal version (use full version)
- `ci-optimized.yml.disabled` - Overlaps with lint-verification.yml
- `test-suite.yml.disabled` - Comprehensive tests (basic test.yml sufficient)
- `pr-validation.yml.disabled` - Redundant with pr-issue-validation.yml
- `pr-required.yml.disabled` - Basic PR enforcement (covered by other workflows)

### Specialized Features (Re-enable as needed)
- `context-lint.yml.disabled` - Context YAML validation
- `vector-graph-sync.yml.disabled` - Vector/Graph DB synchronization
- `kv-analytics-sync.yml.disabled` - KV store analytics
- `generate-sprint-issues.yml.disabled` - Auto-generate sprint issues
- `sprint-start.yml.disabled` - Sprint initialization

### Legacy (Already Disabled)
- `auto-merge.yml.disabled` - Replaced by ai-pr-monitor.yml
- `smart-auto-merge.yml.disabled` - Replaced by ai-pr-monitor.yml
- `auto-merge-notifier.yml.disabled` - Replaced by ai-pr-monitor.yml
- `auto-merge-completion-notifier.yml.disabled` - Replaced by ai-pr-monitor.yml
- `arc-follow-up-processor.yml.disabled` - Replaced by ai-pr-monitor.yml

## Benefits of Streamlining

### Reduced Complexity
- **50% fewer workflows** to understand and maintain
- **Eliminated redundancy** between similar workflows
- **Clearer responsibilities** - each workflow has distinct purpose

### Improved Performance
- **Fewer concurrent jobs** reducing GitHub Actions minutes usage
- **Faster CI feedback** with essential checks only
- **Reduced notification noise** from redundant workflow runs

### Easier Maintenance
- **Single source of truth** for each function (e.g., ai-pr-monitor for auto-merge)
- **Clearer debugging** when issues arise
- **Simpler onboarding** for new team members

## Re-enabling Disabled Workflows

To re-enable a workflow:
```bash
# Example: Re-enable context validation
mv .github/workflows/context-lint.yml.disabled .github/workflows/context-lint.yml
```

## Monitoring and Adjustment

Monitor the streamlined workflows for 1-2 weeks:
- Ensure all essential functionality is preserved
- Check for any missing automation
- Re-enable specific workflows if needed
