            **Status**: ✅ All checks passed, ARC-Reviewer approved, auto-merged

            The auto-merge system worked end-to-end:
            - ✅ CI checks passed
            - ✅ ARC-Reviewer approved with no blocking issues
            - ✅ Branch conflicts resolved (if any)
            - ✅ Auto-merge enabled and executed

            Great job! The automation is working perfectly.
