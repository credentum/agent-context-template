# Final test for workflow timing fix

This PR tests the corrected workflow that separates:
1. Review process (runs on PR open/sync)
2. Issue creation (runs on PR close/merge)

When this PR is merged, the post-merge job should:
- Find Claude's review comments with ISSUE: suggestions
- Create an aggregated follow-up issue
- Properly handle the timing to avoid race conditions
