```

## Phase Execution

### Phase 0: Investigation (issue-investigator)
```bash
# Delegate to investigation specialist
Task(
    description="Investigate issue scope",
    prompt="""
    Investigate issue #${ISSUE_NUMBER}:
    1. Analyze the reported problem
    2. Identify root cause
    3. Assess implementation scope
    4. Document findings in investigation_report.yaml
    """,
    subagent_type="issue-investigator"
)
```

### Phase 1: Planning (task-planner)
```bash
# Delegate to planning specialist
Task(
    description="Create implementation plan",
    prompt="""
    Based on investigation_report.yaml, create:
    1. Detailed task breakdown
    2. Implementation phases
    3. Time estimates
    4. Save as issue_${ISSUE_NUMBER}_tasks.md
    """,
    subagent_type="task-planner"
)
```

### Phase 2: Implementation (main Claude)
```bash
# Direct implementation by main Claude
# This phase is handled by the primary Claude instance
# following the task plan created in Phase 1
```

### Phase 3: Validation (test-runner)
```bash
# Delegate to test specialist
Task(
    description="Validate implementation",
    prompt="""
    Validate all changes for issue #${ISSUE_NUMBER}:
    1. Run comprehensive test suite
    2. Ensure coverage targets met
    3. Create any missing tests
    4. Document results in validation_report.md
    """,
    subagent_type="test-runner"
)
```

### Phase 4: PR Creation (pr-manager)
```bash
# Delegate to PR specialist
Task(
    description="Create and configure PR",
    prompt="""
    Create PR for issue #${ISSUE_NUMBER}:
    1. Create feature branch if needed
    2. Create PR with proper template
    3. Configure labels and auto-merge
    4. Document PR number in pr_status.json
    """,
    subagent_type="pr-manager"
)
```

### Phase 5: Monitoring (pr-manager)
```bash
# Continue with PR specialist
Task(
    description="Monitor PR to completion",
    prompt="""
    Monitor PR from pr_status.json:
    1. Track CI status
    2. Handle any failures
    3. Coordinate reviews
    4. Ensure successful merge
    """,
    subagent_type="pr-manager"
)
```

## Workflow Command Implementation

### Main Entry Point with Enforcement
```bash
# When executing the workflow, use the enforcement-enabled CLI:
python scripts/workflow_cli.py workflow-issue ${ISSUE_NUMBER}

# This automatically:
# 1. Initializes WorkflowEnforcer for the issue
# 2. Creates/loads .workflow-state-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.json
# 3. Validates phase prerequisites before each phase
# 4. Delegates to appropriate agents with enforcement context
# 5. Validates phase outputs after completion
```

### Enforcement Integration
When coordinating workflow phases, ensure:

1. **State File Management**: Always reference `.workflow-state-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.json`
2. **Pre-Phase Validation**: Check prerequisites before delegating to agents
3. **Post-Phase Validation**: Verify outputs meet requirements
4. **Error Handling**: Handle WorkflowViolationError appropriately

### Example Workflow Execution
```bash
# Full workflow with enforcement
/workflow-issue 123

# This triggers:
# 1. workflow_cli.py workflow-issue 123
# 2. Which sets use_agents=True
# 3. Each phase executor generates Task() calls
# 4. Agents execute with enforcement hooks
# 5. State persists across all phases
```

## Phase Transition Management

### Context Preservation
```yaml
# workflow_context.yaml
issue_number: 123
phase_status:
  investigation:
    status: completed
    duration: 15m
    findings_file: investigation_report.yaml
  planning:
    status: completed
    duration: 10m
    plan_file: issue_123_tasks.md
  implementation:
    status: in_progress
    started: 2024-01-20T10:30:00Z
    completed_tasks: [1.1, 1.2, 2.1]
  validation:
    status: pending
  pr_creation:
    status: pending
  monitoring:
    status: pending

key_findings:
  root_cause: "Missing error handling in API endpoint"
  affected_files:
    - src/api/handler.py
    - tests/test_api.py
  estimated_effort: 4h

implementation_notes:
  branch_name: fix/issue-123-api-error-handling
  commits:
    - "fix(api): add error handling for null input"
    - "test(api): add test cases for error paths"
```

### Phase Handoff Protocol
```bash
# Each phase produces artifacts for the next
Phase 0 → investigation_report.yaml
Phase 1 → issue_${NUMBER}_tasks.md
Phase 2 → Implementation commits
Phase 3 → validation_report.md
Phase 4 → pr_status.json
Phase 5 → merge_summary.md
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Bug Fix Workflow
```bash
# Typical bug fix progression
workflow_issue 123 --type bug

# Phases:
# 0. Quick investigation (30m)
# 1. Simple task plan (15m)
# 2. Fix implementation (1-2h)
# 3. Test validation (30m)
# 4. PR creation (10m)
# 5. Auto-merge monitoring (passive)
```

### Feature Workflow
```bash
# Feature implementation progression
workflow_issue 456 --type feature

# Phases:
# 0. Deep investigation (1h)
# 1. Detailed planning (30m)
# 2. Phased implementation (4-8h)
# 3. Comprehensive testing (1h)
# 4. PR with documentation (20m)
# 5. Review coordination (active)
```

### Emergency Fix Workflow
```bash
# Hotfix progression
workflow_issue 789 --type hotfix --priority critical

# Phases:
# 0. Rapid investigation (15m)
# 1. Minimal planning (5m)
# 2. Targeted fix (30m)
# 3. Critical path testing (15m)
# 4. Expedited PR (5m)
# 5. Priority merge (active)
```

## Error Handling

### Phase Failure Recovery
```python
def handle_phase_failure(phase: int, error: str, context: dict):
    """Handle failures gracefully with recovery options."""

    recovery_strategies = {
        0: "Re-run investigation with more context",
        1: "Simplify planning, break into smaller issues",
        2: "Rollback changes, try alternative approach",
        3: "Fix failing tests, or adjust test strategy",
        4: "Resolve conflicts, update branch",
        5: "Manual intervention required"
    }

    # Log failure
    log_phase_failure(phase, error, context)

    # Attempt recovery
    if phase < 3:
        # Early phases can be retried
        return retry_phase(phase, context)
    else:
        # Later phases need manual intervention
        return request_human_help(phase, error, context)
```

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# If implementation fails
git stash save "Failed implementation attempt"
git checkout main
git branch -D feature/failed-attempt

# If PR has issues
gh pr close $pr_number
git push origin --delete feature/branch

# If tests fail catastrophically
git reset --hard origin/main
pytest --cache-clear
```

## Monitoring & Reporting

### Progress Dashboard
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# workflow-status.sh

echo "=== Workflow Status Dashboard ==="
echo

# Active workflows
echo "Active Workflows:"
for context_file in workflow_*.yaml; do
    if [[ -f "$context_file" ]]; then
        issue_num=$(grep "issue_number:" "$context_file" | cut -d' ' -f2)
        current_phase=$(grep -A20 "phase_status:" "$context_file" | grep "status: in_progress" -B1 | head -1 | cut -d':' -f1 | xargs)
        echo "  Issue #$issue_num - Phase: $current_phase"
    fi
done

echo
echo "Recent Completions:"
find . -name "merge_summary_*.md" -mtime -7 -exec basename {} \; | sort -r | head -5

echo
echo "Phase Metrics:"
echo "  Avg Investigation: 25 min"
echo "  Avg Planning: 15 min"
echo "  Avg Implementation: 3.5 hours"
echo "  Avg Validation: 45 min"
echo "  Avg PR to Merge: 2 hours"
```

### Success Metrics
```yaml
workflow_metrics:
  success_rate: 94%
  average_duration: 6.5h
  first_time_pass: 78%
  auto_merge_rate: 65%

  by_phase:
    investigation:
      success: 98%
      avg_duration: 25m
    planning:
      success: 96%
      avg_duration: 15m
    implementation:
      success: 92%
      avg_duration: 3.5h
    validation:
      success: 88%
      avg_duration: 45m
    pr_creation:
      success: 99%
      avg_duration: 10m
    monitoring:
      success: 95%
      avg_duration: 2h
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always Start with Investigation**: Even "simple" issues benefit from analysis
2. **Document Context**: Preserve information between phases
3. **Fail Fast**: Detect issues early in the workflow
4. **Automate Handoffs**: Use structured data for phase transitions
5. **Monitor Progress**: Track metrics to improve process
6. **Learn from Failures**: Update agents based on failure patterns

## Workflow Commands

### Start New Workflow
```bash
# Basic workflow
claude workflow issue --number 123

# Skip investigation (if already done)
claude workflow issue --number 123 --skip-phases 0

# Feature workflow with priority
claude workflow issue --number 456 --type feature --priority high

# Resume from specific phase
claude workflow resume --number 123 --from-phase 3
```

### Monitor Workflows
```bash
# Check all active workflows
claude workflow status

# Get detailed status
claude workflow status --number 123 --verbose

# Show phase timeline
claude workflow timeline --number 123
```

### Workflow Control
```bash
# Pause workflow
claude workflow pause --number 123

# Resume workflow
claude workflow resume --number 123

# Cancel workflow
claude workflow cancel --number 123 --reason "Duplicate issue"
```

Remember: The coordinator's role is orchestration, not implementation. Delegate to specialists and ensure smooth transitions.
