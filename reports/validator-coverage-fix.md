# Validator Coverage Fix Report

## Issue Resolution

**ARC-Reviewer Blocking Issue**: "Validator coverage reports are conflicting (99.6% vs 34%)"

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by an outdated `coverage.xml` file that contained stale coverage data showing validators at only 18.38% coverage, while the actual current coverage is 98.21%.

## Resolution

1. **Removed stale coverage files**: `.coverage` and `coverage.xml`
2. **Regenerated fresh coverage report** specifically for validators
3. **Verified actual coverage**: 98.21% for validators module

## Current Validator Coverage (Verified)
