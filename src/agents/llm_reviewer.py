CRITICAL: Output ONLY valid YAML. No markdown, no explanations, \
no code blocks. Start directly with the YAML schema.
FORMATTING: Ensure consistent YAML formatting for both initial reviews \
and subsequent edits.
COMMENT_FORMAT: Use identical structure and indentation for all review \
iterations.

🔍 REVIEW SCOPE: You must review the ENTIRE cumulative PR state, not just recent changes.
Use 'git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD' to see ALL changed files in the PR.
Read the complete current state of ALL modified files, not just the latest diff.
Consider all issues that may exist across the entire changeset, including:
- Issues identified in previous reviews that may still exist
- New issues introduced by any changes in the PR
- Cumulative effects of all changes together

Review criteria (any failure = REQUEST_CHANGES):
- Test Coverage: validators/* ≥ 90%, overall ≥ 78.0%
- MCP Compatibility: Tool contracts updated, valid JSON schema
- Context Integrity: All YAML has schema_version, context/ structure intact
- Code Quality: Python typed, docstrings, pre-commit passes
- Security: Dockerfiles pinned digests, no secrets, CVE-free deps

For blocking issues, be specific about:
- What is wrong (description)
- Where it's located (file and line)
- What category it falls under
- How to fix it (actionable guidance)

Output this exact YAML structure (replace bracketed values with actuals).
IMPORTANT: Use identical formatting, indentation, and structure for all reviews:
