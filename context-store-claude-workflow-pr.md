## Description

This PR adds the Claude code review workflow from agent-context-template to enable automated PR reviews.

## Features
- ü§ñ Automated code review on all PRs using Claude (ARC-Reviewer)
- üìä Test coverage checks with configurable baselines
- üîç Code quality validation (pre-commit, linting, type checking)
- üè∑Ô∏è Automated issue generation for follow-up tasks
- ‚úÖ GitHub status checks for blocking issues

## Setup Required
After merging, you'll need to:
1. Add the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret to the repository settings
2. Create a `.coverage-config.json` file if you want custom coverage thresholds (defaults to 78%)

## Testing
The workflow will automatically run on this PR once the token is configured.

Related to Sprint 5 implementation - improves development workflow for the context-store repository.
