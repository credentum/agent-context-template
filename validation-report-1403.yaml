    CRITICAL VALIDATION FAILURES FOUND

    The comprehensive local CI validation for PR #1402 reveals significant
    issues that would prevent successful GitHub Actions execution:

    1. YAML VALIDATION CRISIS: sprint-4.1.yaml has syntax errors at line 367
       that will cause workflow failures

    2. PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS: Docker CI and ARC-Reviewer exceed reasonable
       execution times (>7min, >2min respectively)

    3. MISSING DEPENDENCIES: pytest-benchmark and several CI modules missing
       from test environment

    4. TYPE CHECKING FAILURES: 15 MyPy errors in test files indicate code
       quality issues

    RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT SUBMIT PRs until these blocking issues are resolved.
    Estimated fix time: 2-3 hours for YAML issues, dependency installation,
    and performance optimization.

  blocking_issues_count: 4

  remediation_steps:
    immediate_fixes:
      - 'Fix YAML syntax error in context/sprints/sprint-4.1.yaml line 367'
      - 'Add missing document start markers (---) to schema files'
      - 'Install pytest-benchmark: pip install pytest-benchmark'
      - 'Fix line length violations in sprint YAML files'

    performance_optimizations:
      - 'Optimize Docker CI execution time from 7+ minutes to <5 minutes'
      - 'Configure ARC-Reviewer timeout and performance settings'
      - 'Consider selective test execution for faster validation'

    code_quality_fixes:
      - 'Resolve 15 MyPy type checking errors in tests/'
      - 'Add missing module implementations for CI components'
      - 'Update flake8 violations in codebase'
