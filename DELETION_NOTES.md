# File Deletion Notes for PR #1671

## scripts/validators/workflow_validator.py

This file was deleted because:

1. **Duplicate functionality**: The actual workflow validator is located at `.claude/workflows/workflow-validator.py`
2. **MyPy conflict**: Having two files with similar names was causing MyPy module name conflicts
3. **Consolidation**: All workflow validation logic should be centralized in the `.claude/workflows/` directory

The deleted file appears to be a wrapper that was importing from `workflow_enforcer.py`, while the main implementation is in `.claude/workflows/workflow-validator.py`.

## Impact Analysis

- No other active code references this file (only historical references in trace files from issue #1645)
- The functionality is fully preserved in `.claude/workflows/workflow-validator.py`
- This resolves the MyPy duplicate module error reported by the ARC reviewer
